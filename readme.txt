A sidebar widget that displays a certain number of topics from a tinyForum installation.

== Description ==

<a href="http://tinyforum.us/">tinyForum</a> is a simple and lightweight forum built using the <a href="http://tinyphp.us/">tinyPHP MVC Framework</a>. With this widget, you can display a set number of recent topics from a tinyForum installation. If you would like to integrate your members with tinyForum, I suggest checking out the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/external-db-auth-reloaded/">External Database Authentication Reloaded plugin</a>.


== Installation ==

1. Install the widget by uploading it via ftp to your plugins directory or via the plugins installer in the backend.
2. Activate the plugin, visit the settings page, enter your database and forum details.
3. Add the widget to the sidebar, and you should see your recent tinyForum topics.
